# Animated Ad in HTML/CSS/JS

This project represents my first technical test marking the beginning of my journey as a web developer. It's built using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The project showcases an animated advertising format optimized for iPhone 6. (Please note that while it's tailored for iPhone 6, some animations and proportions may not translate seamlessly to other dimensions.)

This initial experience paved the way for a 2-year tenure as a Front-End Developer @Adot, where I encountered numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth.

## Integration of Google Maps API

The project also demonstrates the integration of the Google Maps API.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with it!
